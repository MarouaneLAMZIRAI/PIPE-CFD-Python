# PIPE-CFD-Python
Using advanced algorithms and mathematical models, the code efficiently simulates fluid behavior, taking into account factors such as pipe geometry, fluid properties, and boundary conditions. With just a few inputs, you can obtain accurate results for pressure, velocity, and flow rate distribution within the pipe network.
